---
This is Numerical Methods in Finance in  2022 fall master in NYCU. Teaching by prof.戴天時 <br>
Including <br>
- base C++ language skill
- binomical tree methods
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Variance reduction method
- Interest rate model 

After the course, I think it is no matter you learn the C++ before or not, but you need some pricing knowledge for finanical derivative. For example how to build the binomical tree or how to discount.
